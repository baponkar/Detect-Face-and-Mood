# Detect-Face-and-Mood
Detecting face and mood by opencv2
This program uses the camera as the video source, OpenCV to detect the faces and a pre-trained deep learning model to identify the mood of the face. The program detects faces in the video frames using the Haar cascade classifier, then it uses the DNN (Deep Neural Network) model to predict the mood of the face based on the face ROI (Region of Interest). The program displays the predicted mood on the frame.
